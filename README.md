This project follows a stage-based model approach to address the issue of snus consumption among diverse user cohorts. Here's a brief outline of our approach:
  
  1. Analysis: We began by analyzing data collected from various user cohorts to understand consumption and urge patterns related to snus usage.
  2. Prototype Development: Using the insights from our analysis, we developed a low-fidelity prototype aimed at addressing the identified consumption patterns.
  3. Experiments and Evaluations: We conducted experiments and evaluations to assess the effectiveness of different visualization techniques in conveying consumption patterns to users.
  4. Results and Discussion: Based on our findings, we discussed the effectiveness of our approach in uncovering user preferences andinforming future strategies for snus consumption analysis and user engagement.

Future Work: We outlined potential avenues for future work, including the development of semi-automatedtracking solutions and the integration of additional features into the prototype.
